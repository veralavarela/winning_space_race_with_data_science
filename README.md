# Winning Space Race With Data Science
Data Science and Machine Learning - Capstone Project

In this capstone, I'll predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars. Other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

In this repository you will find some notebooks used in this project:
(i) data collection - API (DataCollection_SpaceXAPI.ipynb);
(ii) data collection - scraping (DataCollection_Scraping.ipynb);
(iii) data wrangling (DataWrangling.ipynb);
(iv) EDA with data visualization (EDAwithVisualization.ipynb);
(v) EDA with SQL (EDAwithSQL.ipynb);
(vi) Interactive Map with Folium (InteractiveMapwithFolium.ipynb);
(vii) Dashboard with Plotly Dash (DashboardwithPlotlyDash.py);
(viii) Predictive Analysis - Classification (PredictiveAnalysisClassification.ipynb).
